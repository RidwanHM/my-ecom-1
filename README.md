This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

CA Report: e-Commerce Store with API Integration
For this course assignment we work in a group of two. We completed the development of an online store using the provided API link: https://api.noroff.dev/api/v1/online-shop. This report outlines the creation of essential pages like the Homepage, Individual Product Page, Cart Page, Checkout Success Page, and Contact Page.
The homepage displays all available products. Clicking on any product will take users to the product page. The header includes navigation link for Home, Contact and a Cart icon displaying the number of items in the cart.
Detailed information about each product is presented on its own page. Users can see the product title, description and image. They can also add the product to their cart with a single click. Prices are displayed with any discounts clearly shown.
Clicking on the Cart icon leads users to a page showing all items in their cart along with the total cost. From here, they can proceed to checkout seamlessly. After successfully checking out, users are directed to a page confirming their order. They are provided with a link to return to the store, and their cart is cleared automatically.
A Contact Page has been added with a simple form for users to reach out. The form ensures that users provide necessary information and validates their input.
We made sure the design looks good on different devices by using Tailwind CSS for styling. The online store is easy to use, making shopping straightforward for users. We used the API effectively and added features that are easy for customers to use.
